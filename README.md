# WEB103 Project 4 - Grocery List App

Submitted by: Roel Crodua

### About this web app: 
`GroceryList` is a customizable grocery planning app that lets users build personalized shopping lists by selecting items from a catalog, adjusting quantities and units, adding custom labels and notes, and seeing their list update with live totals and category-based visuals. Built with React on the frontend and a PostgreSQL-backed Express API on the backend, the app supports full CRUD functionality so users can create, view, edit, and delete grocery lists and list items while exploring a more personalized take on everyday shopping.**

Time spent: 10 hours
